# Gleaning-of-Automotive-Entity-details-from-Dynamically-Occluded-Environments

Problem Statement

        Traditional ALPR systems fail when license plates are partially occluded by other vehicles, weather conditions, or obstacles. Occlusion rates of 50-70% are common in dense traffic scenarios, leading to significant recognition failures.


Project Scope

Develop a vehicle-centric multi-frame recognition system that tracks each vehicle across 5-7 frames, applies temporal fusion, and performs batch recognition post-lifecycle. Target applications include automated toll collection, smart parking, traffic law enforcement, and vehicle tracking systems.
